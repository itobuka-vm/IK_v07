          <h3>Current concepts of copyright work</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            He is currently looking for color and material in his work
            the best to show the changes and metamorphoses of the natural into the artificial and
            vice versa. He is experimenting with material and changing
            two-dimensional to three-dimensional. Uses natural and
            artificial materials: wood, wires, clearing. It has a concept to extend
            cycle and increase the number of images of the same story. Her landscape is eternal
            inspiration seen through broken glass, with geometrization
            thereby finding a stylized manuscript of natural flow and movement. U
            images of larger dimensions include light and the position of the observer in
            to the work as a path to a new experience of the same. A game
            light, shadows and relief, matte and glossy surfaces unfold
            being on her works.
