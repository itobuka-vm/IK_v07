          <p class="text-justify">
            On July 30, 2019, the Notr Dam Summer Art Workshop - Gracanica was held at the Nadezda Petrovic Art Gallery. By highlighting these two buildings, the workshop highlighted the value of the entire world cultural heritage, which, unfortunately, is often threatened by the history of war, neglect, natural disasters and other circumstances. This workshop gave the children a close encounter with the original paintings of Nadežda Petrović - Gracanica from 1913 and the painting of Božidar Prodanović - Our Lady of the Church from 1953. The workshops were intended for children and adults alike, but the largest number of visitors and actors of this event was between 5 and 12 years old. The reason for the workshops was the support to the Notre Dam church in Paris, which was destroyed in the fire, so the motive for the painting was the famous cathedral, but as a pandemic to this building, also Gracanica, the pearl of Serbian medieval architecture. About 40 visitors to the gallery participated in this workshop. The curator of the gallery was Dragana Bozovic, and the workshop was coordinated by the painter Ivana Knezevic.

          <p class="text-justify">
            In addition to classes in CREATIVE LAMP and work in the studio itself, children often go out in nature. As part of the workshop, small creatives spend a lot of time in a nearby park, where all the senses enjoy the green of the trees, the variety of visitors on a sunny day and the murmur of water, they observe and perceive the world around them. In the field, they draw and paint but also collect material from nature from which they can make toys and usable objects. They thus enhance environmental awareness and respect for nature, breathe clean air, play, talk about colors, textures, line and light, how healthy it is to be active and respect nature. Through conversation and examples in the field, they raise the awareness that we have come to love a great organism that makes and changes an ecosystem. They are introduced to a wide variety of plants, run, hide and jump.

          <p class="text-justify">
            The participants of the Creative Burrow and fellow citizens inspired by the exhibition at the Nadezda Petrovic Art Gallery have done their little artwork that has revealed the stories of the paintings. The exhibition exhibition entitled PICTURES AND THEIR SECRETS hosted Ivana Knezevic and her small artists twice. One workshop was held in the beautiful space of the gallery courtyard. The children and their parents were drawing and painting and painting already printed segments of paintings by the great masters. The creators imaginatively answered the question of what this painting might be hiding, and with the expert guidance of the curator of the exhibition, Danilo Mikić, they got to know the original works of art placed in the gallery. The wonderful mass gathering was followed by a beautiful sunny day, so the colors used were illuminated with happiness and positive energy. For the second time, the creators in the gallery themselves had a workshop, but their techniques were changed, they worked on collage and used dry colors to finish the work. Both workshops were extremely attended.

          <p class="text-justify">
            In mid-2018, the author's great pleasure was the invitation of the owner of a private kindergarten for the author to revive and paint the space of a large antique house where a lounge for the youngest should open. The space itself is a renovated house that was built in the middle of the 20th century, the space was in good condition but required special decoration and authenticity of mobile phones. Inspiration was not missing, a meadow scene appeared on the main wall of the living room. In the great shade of the oak that stretched across the ceiling in stucco relief, a small family of owls was also painted. Meadows and sunny days were enriched by a variety of bugs and birds and on the opposite end of the wall stood susuncokrets with their occupants, grasshoppers and ants. The meadow is richly painted, with lots of herbs, ferns and mushrooms. The insects are stylized and illustrated to give educators the space to tell a toddler each time a new story illustrated by a painting on the wall. The eyes of all bugs are two-dimensional and bulging so that the youngest can touch them.

            The School of Journalism for Children and Young People - a Degree to Competence for Contemporary Society, visited the CREATIVE JAZBINE space and with their mentor Natasha Turuntsash and host Ivan Knezevic addressed and became acquainted with the process of creative emergence and inspiration of artists. Young future journalists talked about fine arts, choice of profession, creativity, initiative, but also about society, nobility, feelings, differences and feelings of those children who are victims of social violence. The whole visit was inspired by the personal experiences of the host and the stories of Sladjana Parezanovic about their fictional and possibly real peers and their problems. The task was for young journalists to create a story and record a conversation with a painter, but also to be inspired by the subject themselves to be creative and try their hand at being artists.

Stylized spheres represent ideas that will be born and born in start-up communities and their interconnectedness and complementarity, which often happens when experiences and ideas are exchanged. The dimensions of this wall are 4m x 9m and on the wall there is a box with an installation that was ejected from the surface of the wall; The author also solved the color relief side of the conference room wall in Start up.
